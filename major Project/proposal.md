# Major Project Proposal
For my major project, I will be attempting to make a choose your own adventure game. It will include a basic form of combat, an inventory, and multiple choices.

## Need's To Have
- Combat
- A means of inputing your answer
- A box for multiple choice
- Music
- Inventory

## Nice To Have
- A means of remembering past choices
- Imagery
- Video(?)
- An improved User Interface(UI)
- Crafting System (Most likely won't have time for)
- Spell Creation (Same situation as Crafting System)
