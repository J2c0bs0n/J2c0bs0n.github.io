## Problems && Challenges
There weren't any major problems or challenges while I was working, but I did come across some minor ones.

  - When adding music, misplaced music in draw() instead of setup()
  - Integrating a memory checker in a way I wanted (like a TellTale game), went for a primitve version instead so as to not waste time
  - Getting the starting text to show under specific conditions
  - Figuring out how to continue the story (very primitive), but got it figured out
  - Had to constantly reaccess the wants of my proposal, since I had put high expectations on myself
  - Adding enough choices, and getting some to work only under specific condtions

## Things I'm Proud Of
 - Integrating a memory checker, though more primitve then I original desired
 - Having a story, although a very short one
 - Creating a choose-your-own-adventure game

## Reflection
Overall, I'm happy the game is where it's at, even if it's not very far. 
The game is nowhere near complete, and it's more of a demo of a game then anything else, but I'm still happy that it exists.
If there's anything that I would tell my past self about it, is to not start with ridiculously high expectations and standards, and instead start with something small, and work off that.
Thank you for taking the time out of your day, and using it to read this reflection. I hope you enjoy (or enjoyed if you already played) my game, and I hope you have a great day, night, or afternoon.
